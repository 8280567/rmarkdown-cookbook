## Add logo to title page
<!--- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29389149/add-image-in-title-page-of-rmarkdown-pdf --->

We can use the **titling** LaTeX package to alter our title block to include an image. We can include the following lines of text in our YAML, where we change the `my-image` with your local image file:

```yaml
- \usepackage{titling}
- \pretitle{\begin{center}\LARGE\includegraphics[width=6cm]{my-image}\\[\bigskipamount]}
- \posttitle{\end{center}}
```
An example output is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:latexLogo).

```{r latexLogo, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Example LaTeX title with logo"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/latexLogo.png", dpi = NA)
```
