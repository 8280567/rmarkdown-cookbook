## LaTeX subfigures

When writing a document you may want to include some slightly more complicated figures with multiple images. Subfigures are a useful LaTeX feature which allows us to achieve this by plotting multiple figures within a single plot and providing each with their own subcaption.

Subfigures require the LaTeX package `subfig`. The line `\usepackage{subfig}` must therefore be included within the YAML, or if you are using an external tex template you can add this to that file. For example:

As listed within the knitr [chunk options](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/), subfigures require a few additional settings to be set in the chunk header:

- `fig.subcap` is a list of the captions for subfigures
- `fig.ncol`: the number of columns of subfigures
- `out.width`: the output width of the figures. You will normally set this 100% divided by the number of sub columns.

An example is demonstrated below:

````
```{yaml, eval = FALSE}
output:
  pdf_document:
    extra_dependencies: subfig
```

`r ''````{r fig-sub, fig.cap='two plots', fig.subcap=c('one plot', 'the other one'), out.width='.49\\linewidth', fig.asp=1, fig.ncol = 2}
plot(1:10)
plot(rnorm(10), pch=19)
```
````

The output is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:subcaptions).

```{r subcaptions, fig.cap="An example subcaption"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/subfigure.png", dpi = NA)
```
