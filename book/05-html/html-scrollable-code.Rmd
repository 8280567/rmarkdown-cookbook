## Scrollable Code Chunks {#html-scroll}

If we are including large amounts of code within our documents, we may want the code chunks to be limited in height with a scroll bar to navigate through the full details. Such a code chunk is highlighted in Figure \@ref(fig:scrollableCode). Here we demonstrate several ways in which this behaviour could be implemented.

```{r scrollableCode, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A Scrollable Code chunk using custom CSS"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/scrollableCode.png", dpi = NA)
```

### Overwriting the Default CSS

The simplist way of adding a scroll bar is to overwrite the global CSS options for the document. This will change the behaviour of all code chunks within the document. This requires us to specify the following CSS, where the user can set the height of the box using the `max-height` option:

```{css, eval = FALSE}
pre {
  max-height: 300px;
  float: left;
  width: 910px;
  overflow-y: auto;
}

pre.r {
  max-height: none;
}
```

### Specifing Additional CSS

If you would desire more control over when the scroll bar is used, you may prefer to specify another style class which we can used when required. Below, we have created an additional class called 'scroll' which we can include within our R Markdown document:

```{css, eval = FALSE}
.scroll {
  max-height: 300px;
  float: left;
  width: 910px;
  overflow-y: auto;
}
```

To use this class, we can specify the 'class.output' option within the code chunk header:

````
```{r, class.output = "scroll"}`r ''`
print(cars)
```
````

### User-specified chunk height

This example is extended further within Section \@ref(hooks-scroll), which uses chunk hooks to allow for user-specified heights.
