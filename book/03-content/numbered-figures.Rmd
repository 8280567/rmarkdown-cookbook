## Adding numbered figure captions

<!--- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37116632/r-markdown-html-number-figures --->

We can use the **bookdown** to add figure numbers to the figure captions. An example is provided below:

```yaml
---
output: bookdown::html_document2
---
```

````md
```{r cars, fig.cap = "An amazing plot"}`r ''`
plot(cars)
```

```{r cars2, fig.cap = "Another amazing plot"}`r ''`
plot(cars)
```
````

Section \@ref(crossRef) demonstrates how we can extend this further by cross-referencing the numbered figures within the text.
