# LaTeX

For many authors, the main output of their work will be the PDF report, and will be able to utilise the styling of LaTeX. In this chapter, we discuss approaches which can be used to customise the output of PDF reports.

By tailoring your work to a single output format (PDF/Word/HTML), you may improve the appearance and performance of a single output but at the expense of this tranferability.
