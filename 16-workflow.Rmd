# Workflow

In this chapter, we introduce some tips on working with individual R Markdown documents as well as running your R Markdown projects.

## RStudio keyboard shortcuts {#rstudio-shortcuts}

The R Markdown format can be used with any editor of your choice, as long as R, the **rmarkdown** package, and Pandoc are installed. However, RStudio has a deep integration with R Markdown so you can work with R Markdown smoothly.

Like any IDE, RStudio has keyboard shortcuts. A full list can be found under the menu `Tools -> Keyboard Shortcuts Help.` Some of the most useful shortcuts related to R Markdown are summarized in Table \@ref(tab:shortcuts).

```{r, include = FALSE}
ks_win <- function(letters, ctrl = TRUE, alt = TRUE, shift = FALSE, enter = FALSE) {
  paste0(
    if (ctrl) "Ctrl+",
    if (alt) "Alt+",
    if (shift) "Shift+",
    if (enter) "Enter+",
    letters
  )
}
ks_mac <- function(letters, cmd = TRUE, opt = TRUE, shift = FALSE, enter = FALSE) {
  paste0(
    if (cmd) "Command+",
    if (opt) "Option+",
    if (shift) "Shift+",
    if (enter) "Enter+",
    letters
  )
}
```

```{r shortcuts, echo = FALSE}
keyboard_table <- tibble::tribble(
  ~ "Task"             , ~ "Windows & Linux"                    , ~ "macOS",
  "Insert R chunk"            , ks_win("I")                            , ks_mac("I"),
  "Preview HTML"              , ks_win("K", alt = FALSE, shift = TRUE) , ks_mac("K", opt = FALSE, shift = TRUE),
  "Knitr document (knitr)"    , ks_win("K", alt = FALSE, shift = TRUE) , ks_mac("K", opt = FALSE, shift = TRUE),
  "Compile Notebook"          , ks_win("K", alt = FALSE, shift = TRUE) , ks_mac("K", opt = FALSE, shift = TRUE),
  "Compile PDF"               , ks_win("K", alt = FALSE, shift = TRUE) , ks_mac("K", opt = FALSE, shift = TRUE),
  "Run all chunks above"      , ks_win("P")                            , ks_mac("P"),
  "Run current chunk"         , ks_win("C")                            , ks_mac("C"),
  "Run current chunk"         , ks_win("Enter", TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)     , ks_mac("Enter", TRUE, FALSE, TRUE),
  "Run next chunk"            , ks_win("N")                            , ks_mac("N"),
  "Run all chunks"            , ks_win("R")                            , ks_mac("R"),
  "Go to next chunk/title"    , ks_win("PgDown", alt = FALSE)          , ks_mac("PgDown", opt = FALSE),
  "Go to previous chunk/title", ks_win("PgUp", alt = FALSE)            , ks_mac("PgUp", opt = FALSE),
  "Show/hide document outline", ks_win("O", TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)         , ks_mac("O", TRUE, FALSE, TRUE),
  "Build book, website, ..."  , ks_win("B", TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)         , ks_mac("B", TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
)
knitr::kable(keyboard_table, caption = "RStudio keyboard shortcuts related to R Markdown.", booktabs = TRUE)
```

Besides, you can press `F7` to spellcheck your document. You can also restart the R session by `Ctrl + Alt + F10` (or `Command + Option + F10` on macOS), which can be helpful for reproducibility, because results are more likely to be reproducible if they are computed from a new R session. This can also be done through the dropdown menu "Restart R and Run All Chunks" behind the "Run" button on the toolbar.

## Render R Markdown with `rmarkdown::render()` {#rmarkdown-render}

If you do not use RStudio or any other IDEs, you need to know this fact: R Markdown documents are rendered through the function `rmarkdown::render()`. This means you can programmatically render an R Markdown document in any R script. For example, you could render a series of reports in a `for`-loop for each state of a coutry:

```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
for (state in state.name) {
  rmarkdown::render(
    'input.Rmd', output_file = paste0(state, '.html')
  )
}
```

The output filename will be different for each state. You can also make use of the `state` variable in the document `input.Rmd`, e.g.,

````md
---
title: "A report for `r knitr::inline_expr('state')`"
output: html_document
---

The area of `r knitr::inline_expr('state')` is `r knitr::inline_expr('state.area[state.name == state]')`
square miles.
````

You may read the help page `?rmarkdown::render` to know other possible arguments. Here we just want to mention one of them, i.e., the `clean` argument. This one is particularly helpful for debugging when anything goes wrong with the Pandoc conversion. If you call `rmarkdown::render(..., clean = FALSE)`, all intermediate files will be preserved, including the intermediate `.md` file knitted from the `.Rmd` file. If Pandoc signals an error, you may start debugging from this `.md` file.

## Parameterized reports {#parameterized-reports}

In Section \@ref(rmarkdown-render), we mentioned one way to render a series of reports in a `for`-loop. In fact, `rmarkdown::render()` has an argument named `params` specifically designed for this task. You can parameterize your report through this argument. When you specify parameters for a report, you can use the variable `params` in your report. For example, if you call:

```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
for (state in state.name) {
  rmarkdown::render('input.Rmd', params = list(state = state))
}
```

Then in `input.Rmd`, the object `params` will be a list that contains the `state` variable:

````md
---
title: "A report for `r knitr::inline_expr('params$state')`"
output: html_document
---

The area of `r knitr::inline_expr('params$state')` is
`r knitr::inline_expr('state.area[state.name == params$state]')`
square miles.
````

Another way to specify parameters for a report is to use the YAML field `params`, e.g.,

```yaml
---
title: Parameterized reports
output: html_document
params:
  state: Nebraska
  year: 2019
  midwest: true
---
```

Note that you can include as many parameters in the `params` YAML field or the `params` argument of `rmarkdown::render()`. If both the YAML field and the argument are present, the parameter values in the argument will override the corresponding parameters in YAML. For example, when we call `rmarkdown::render(..., params = list(state = 'Iowa', year = 2018)` on the previous example that has the `params` field, `params$state` will become `Iowa` (instead of `Nebraska`) and `params$year` will become `2018` (instead of `2019`) in the R Markdown document.

When rendering the same R Markdown document to a series of reports, you need to adjust the `output_file` argument of `rmarkdown::render()`, to make sure each report has its unique filename, so you will not accidentally override certain report files. For example, you can write a function to generate a report for each state and each year:

```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
render_one <- function(state, year) {
  # assuming the output format of input.Rmd is PDF
  rmarkdown::render(
    'input.Rmd',
    output_file = paste0(state, '-', year, '.pdf'),
    params = list(state = state, year = year)
  )
}
```

Then you can use nested `for`-loops to generate all reports:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
for (state in state.name) {
  for (year in 2000:2020) {
    render_one(state, year)
  }
}
```

At the end, you will get a series of report files like `Alabama-2000.pdf`, `Alabama-2001.pdf`, ..., `Wyoming-2019.pdf`, and `Wyoming-2020.pdf`.

For parameterized reports, you can also input parameters interactively through a graphical user interface (GUI) created from Shiny. This requires you to provide a `params` field in YAML, and **rmarkdown** will automatically create the GUI using the appropriate input widgets for each parameter (e.g., a checkbox will be provided for a boolean parameter).

To start the GUI, you can call `rmarkdown::render()` with `params = 'ask'` if you do not use RStudio:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::render('input.Rmd', params = 'ask')
```

If you use RStudio, you can click the menu `Knit with Parameters` behind the `Knit` button. Figure \@ref(fig:params-shiny) shows an example GUI for parameters.

```{r, params-shiny, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Knit an R Markdown document with parameters that you can input from a GUI.'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/params-shiny.png', dpi = NA)
```

For more information on parameterized reports, you may read [Chapter 15](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html) of the R Markdown book [@rmarkdown2018].

## Customize the `Knit` button {#custom-knit}

When you click the `Knit` button in RStudio, it will call the `rmarkdown::render()` function in a new R session and output a file of the same base name as the input file in the same directory. For example, running `example.Rmd` with the output format `html_document` will create an output file `example.html`.

There may be situations in which we want to customize how the document is rendered. For example, perhaps we would like the rendered document to contain the current date, or would like to output the compiled report into a different directory. Although we can customize the `render` function using external scripts (See section \@ref(rmarkdown-render)), it can be inconvenient to have to rely on external scripts to compile your report.

It is possible to control the behavior of the knit button by using the `knit` argument within the YAML of your document. This requires a function to be specified with the arguments `inputFile`, and `encoding`.  There are two techniques that we can use to customize the behavior of the knit function:

1. Embed the custom function directly within the YAML
2. Create a custom function and save it in a package

The easiest way of creating a function is to store the code directly within the YAML. We must wrap the entire function in brackets, and any linebreaks in the YAML must start with 4 spaces.  For example, if we want the output filename to include the date it was rendered, we could use the following YAML code:

```yaml
---
knit: (function(inputFile, encoding)
    {rmarkdown::render(input = inputFile,
    encoding = encoding,
    output_file = paste0(tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(inputFile)),
                                         '-',
                                         format(Sys.Date(), "%Y%m%d"),
                                         '.html'))})
---
``` 

For example, we if knitted `example.Rmd` on `r format(Sys.Date(), '%Y/%m/%d')`, the output file name would be `r paste0("example", '-', format(Sys.Date(), '%Y%m%d'), ".html")`.

While the above approach does benefit from simplicity, it may get more complicated if we wish to do more advanced behavior (perhaps creating a directory, setting some other environment variables). Embedding longer functions directly in your YAML may become difficult to manage. It may therefore be worth creating a function which could be used in a package. Taking our example above, we have created an example `knit_with_date` as defined below:

```r
#' Custom Knit function for RStudio
#'
#' @export
knit_with_date <- function(inputFile, encoding) {

  rmarkdown::render(inputFile,
                    encoding = encoding,
                    output_file = paste0(dirname(inputFile),'/', tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(inputFile)),
                                         '-',
                                         format(Sys.Date(), '%Y%m%d'),
                                         '.html'))
  }
```

If we were to add this to the package `myPackage`, you will then be able to refer to your custom Knit function using the following YAML argument:
  
```yaml
---
knit: myPackage::knit_with_date
---
```
                                    
Readers may wish to refer to Section \@ref(rmarkdown-render) to find out more ideas on how they could customize the control of their render function.
