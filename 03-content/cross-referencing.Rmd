## Cross-referencing within documents

<!---https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38861041/knitr-rmarkdown-latex-how-to-cross-reference-figures-and-tables--->

Cross-referencing is a useful way of directing your readers through your document, and can be automatically done within R Markdown. While this is explained in [Section 2.6](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/cross-references.html) from the bookdown book [@xie2016bookdown], it is useful to remind readers of how to use these within documents.

To use cross-references, we must:

- **Use a bookdown output format**: cross-referencing is not provided directly within the base **rmarkdown**, but is provided as an extension. We must therefore use an output format (e.g. `html_document2`, `pdf_document2`, `word_document2`) include this in the YAML `output` field.
- **A caption to your figure or table**: figures without a caption will be included directly as images and will therefore not be a numbered figure.
- **A named code chunk**: this provides our identifier for referencing the chunk from within the text.

Having met these conditions, we can make cross-references within the text using the format `\@ref(type:label)`, where `label` is the chunk label and `type` is the environment being referenced (e.g. `tab`, `fig`, `eqn`). An example is provided below:

```yaml
---
output: bookdown::html_document2
---
```
````markdown
See Figure \@ref(fig:cars-plot)

`r ''````{r cars-plot, fig.cap="A plot caption"}
plot(cars)  # a scatterplot
```

See Table \@ref(tab:mtcars)

`r ''````{r mtcars}
knitr::kable(mtcars[1:5, 1:5], caption = "A caption")
```

````
The output of this document is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:crossReferencing). 

```{r crossReferencing, fig.cap = "Example of cross-referencing within an R Markdown document", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/crossReferencing.png", dpi = NA)
```

```{block2, type = "rmdnote"}
We can also cross-reference equations, theorems and section headers, which are explained further in Section [12.3.5](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/bookdown-markdown.html#cross-referencing) of the R Markdown book [@xie2018].
