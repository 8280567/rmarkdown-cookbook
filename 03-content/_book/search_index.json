This chapter provides short recipes which are useful for tweaking the behaviour of your own R Markdown documents. 1.1 Set Date to Current Date It is useful for the date of the knitted R Markdown document to automatically update each time we rerun the file. To do this, we can add R code directly to the date field in the YAML, and use the Sys.time() function to extract the current date. As this function will by default provide the date and time, we must format it as shown below: --- title: Your title date: &quot;23 September, 2018&quot; --- This will automatically update each time you Knit your document i.e. 23 September, 2018. If we wish to customize the format of the dates, we can alter the time format by providing our own text string. A full table of POSIXct formats is shown in Table @(tab:dateTimeFormats), with some complete examples shown below: %B %Y: “September 2018” %d/%m/%y: “23/09/18” %d/%m/%y: “Sun 23 Sep” Table 1.1: Date Time Formats within R Code Meaning Code Meaning %a Abbreviated weekday %A Full weekday %b Abbreviated month %B Full month %c Locale-specific date and time %d Decimal date %H Decimal hours (24 hour) %I Decimal hours (12 hour) %j Decimal day of the year %m Decimal month %M Decimal minute %p Locale-specific AM/PM %S Decimal second %U Decimal week of the year (starting on Sunday) %w Decimal Weekday (0=Sunday) %W Decimal week of the year (starting on Monday) %x Locale-specific Date %X Locale-specific Time %y 2-digit year %Y 4-digit year %z Offset from GMT %Z Time zone (character) 1.2 Adding Multiple Authors We can add multiple authors to a R Markdown document within the YAML in a number of ways --- title: &quot;Untitled&quot; author: &quot;John Doe, John Smith&quot; output: html_document --- If you would prefer a linebreak between the two authors, we can add --- author: - John Doe^[Their institution] - John Doe 2^[Their institution] output: pdf_document: default html_document: default --- "]
