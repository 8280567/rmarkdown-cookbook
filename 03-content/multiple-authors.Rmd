## Adding Multiple Authors

<!--- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26043807/multiple-authors-and-subtitles-in-rmarkdown-yaml --->

We can add multiple authors to a R Markdown document within the YAML in a number of ways


```yaml
---
title: "Untitled"
author: "John Doe, John Smith"
output: html_document
---
```

If you would prefer a linebreak between the two authors, we can add

```yaml
---
author:
- John Doe^[Their institution]
- John Doe 2^[Their institution]
output:
  pdf_document: default
  html_document: default
---
```
