# (PART) Get Started {-}

# Installation

We assume you have already installed R (https://www.r-project.org) [@R-base] and the RStudio IDE (https://www.rstudio.com). RStudio is not required but recommended, because it makes it easier for an average user to work with R Markdown. If you do not have RStudio IDE installed, you will have to install Pandoc\index{Pandoc} (http://pandoc.org), otherwise there is no need to install Pandoc separately because RStudio has bundled it. Next you can install the **rmarkdown** package in R:

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
# Install from CRAN
install.packages('rmarkdown')

# Or if you want to test the development version,
# install from GitHub
if (!requireNamespace("devtools"))
  install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('rstudio/rmarkdown')
```


# Recommended Reading

There are already several fantastic books out there which you may have already read:

- Dynamic documents and knitr
- R Markdown: The Definitive guide
- Authoring books with bookdown
- Blogdown
