##  Plotting multiple figures side-by-side

As explained in https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/r-code.html#figures of @xie2018, we can place multiple figures side-by-side using the `fig.hold='hold'` along with the `out.width` option. As an example below, we have set the `out.width="50%"`:

```{r fig-sub-2, fig.show ="hold", out.width = "50%", fig.cap="Side-by-side figures", echo = TRUE}
plot(1:10)
plot(rnorm(10), pch=19)
```

The main benefits of this approach is that it is easily achieved, and also works for both PDF and HTML outputs.
