# LaTeX

For many authors, the main  of long reports or books, the primary output will be LaTeX. In this chapter, we discuss approaches which can be used to customise the output of PDF reports.

Users should approach with a note of caution. One of the major benefits of R Markdown is the fact that a single source document can create documents with multiple formats. By tailoring your work to a single output format (PDF/Word/HTML), you may improve the appearance and performance of a single output but at the expense of this tranferability.

## Multi-figure plots

If we need to print multiple output graphs or figures, there are several ways this can be achieved. 

## Cross-output

As explained in https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/r-code.html#figures of @xie2018, we can place multiple figures side-by-side using the `fig.hold='hold'` along with the `out.width` option. As an example below, we have set the `out.width="50%"`:

```{r fig-sub-2, fig.show ="hold", out.width = "50%", fig.cap="Side-by-side figures", echo = TRUE}
plot(1:10)
plot(rnorm(10), pch=19)
```

The main benefits of this approach is that it is easily achieved, and also works for both PDF and HTML outputs.

## LaTeX subfigures

When writing a document you may want to include some slightly more complicated figures with multiple images. Subfigures are a useful LaTeX feature which allows us to achieve this by plotting multiple figures within a single plot and providing each with their own subcaption.

Subfigures require the LaTeX package `subfig`. The line `\usepackage{subfig}` must therefore be included within the YAML, or if you are using an external tex template you can add this to that file. For example:

As listed within the knitr [chunk options](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/), subfigures require a few additional settings to be set in the chunk header:

- `fig.subcap` is a list of the captions for subfigures
- `fig.ncol`: the number of columns of subfigures
- `out.width`: the output width of the figures. You will normally set this 100% divided by the number of sub columns.

An example is demonstrated below:

````
```yaml
output: pdf_document
header-includes:
   - \usepackage{subfig}
```

`r ''````{r fig-sub, fig.cap='two plots', fig.subcap=c('one plot', 'the other one'), out.width='.49\\linewidth', fig.asp=1, fig.ncol = 2}
plot(1:10)
plot(rnorm(10), pch=19)
```
````

The output is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:subcaptions).

```{r subcaptions, fig.cap="An example subcaption"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/subfigure.png", dpi = NA)
```
