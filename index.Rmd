# About the book

This book aims to bring together lots of useful tips for R Markdown.

One of the common criticisms of markdown as a language is that it naturally limits what you can write. Users often therefore feel limited in what they can achieve with advanced customisation. However, we can easily edit.


## Recommended Reading

There are already several fantastic books out there which you may have already read:

- Dynamic documents and knitr
- R Markdown: The Definitive guide
- Authoring books with bookdown
- Blogdown

## Ideas to be written up

- Use `(ref:tag)` to store page formatting options which might need to be reused. For example a page break
- Managing big projects: `source` is particularly useful for loading external scripts so that the R Markdown project isn't too bloated with code.
- Using subfigures within the R Markdown environments: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12546365/subfigures-or-subcaptions-with-knitr/49086985#49086985
- Caching, and ways it can be tailored to suit analysis. This cache invalidation is a great example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18376008/invalidate-a-chunks-cache-when-uncached-chunk-changes
- Knitr hooks: these are explained within your previous book, but i I think a few more practical examples could be very useful for readers to see the power of it.
-Designing custom behavior which can respond to change in outputs using `is_latex_output` etc. For example, you may want to have interactive tables using `DT:datatable` in the HTML output but print static versions in the PDF.
- Creating stylized tables using kableExtra: lots of fun things can be done with this package
- Using short author citations: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48303890/using-short-author-citations-in-bookdown-rmarkdown?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa




```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
