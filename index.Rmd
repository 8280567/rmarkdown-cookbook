# About the book

> This book is in a very early stage of development. If you have any suggestions on what should be included within this book, please get in touch via GitHub: https://github.com/mikey-harper/mastering-rmarkdown

- This book aims to bring together lots of useful tips for R Markdown.
- One of the common criticisms of markdown as a language is that it naturally limits what you can write. Users often therefore feel limited in what they can achieve with advanced customisation. However, we can easily edit.

## Recommended Reading

), 'packages.bib')
