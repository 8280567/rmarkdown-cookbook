# Mastering R Markdown/ R Markdown Cookbook (Working titles)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mikey-harper/mastering-rmarkdown.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mikey-harper/mastering-rmarkdown)

This book expands the existing guidance provided by the [R Markdown Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) with the aim to:

- highlight useful tips and tricks for creating R Markdown documents
- Provide more detailed documentation on advanced R Markdown features

The book is still in early development, and as such content may still very messy with sentences randomly ending!
