# Document Elements

There are lots of small tips and tricks that can be used to customize the content of R Markdown documents. This chapter provides short recipes which are useful for tweaking the behaviour of your own R Markdown documents.



## Bibliographies and citations

<!--- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32946203/including-bibliography-in-rmarkdown-document-with-use-of-the-knitcitations --->

R Markdown makes it easy include citations within your document by using pandoc. For a comprehensive overview, we recommend [Section 2.8](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/citations.html) of @xie2016bookdown. However, the basic usage requires us to specify a bibliography file using the `bibliography` metadata field in the YAML. For example:

```yaml
---
output: html_document
bibliography: references.bib  
---
```

where the A BibTeX database is a plain-text file that consists of bibliography entries like this:

```
@Manual{R-base,
  title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical
    Computing},
  author = {{R Core Team}},
  organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},
  address = {Vienna, Austria},
  year = {2016},
  url = {https://www.R-project.org/},
}
```

Items can be cited directly within the documentation using the first line `@R-base`.

### Changing citation style

By default, pandoc will use a Chicago author-date format for citations and references. To use another style, you will need to specify a CSL 1.0 style file in the `csl` metadata field:

```yaml
---
output: html_document
bibliography: references.bib
csl: biomed-central.csl
---
```

To find your required formats, we recommend using the Zotero [website](https://www.zotero.org/styles), which makes it search for and download your required style.

Although beyond the scope of the book, it is worth highlighting that the behaviour of CSL files can be tweaked to customise the behaviour as required. For example, we can change the number of authors required before "et.al" is used to abbreviate them. This can be simplified through the use of visual editors such as the one found [here](http://editor.citationstyles.org/visualEditor/).

### Add item to bibliography without using it 

By default, the bibliography will only display items which are directly referenced in the document. If you want to include items in the bibliography without actually citing them in the body text, you can define a dummy `nocite` metadata field and put the citations there. This can be included anywhere in the document but it is normally best to place it at the end of the document:

```md
# References
---
nocite: |
 @item1, @item2
...
```


### Add all items to bibliography

If we do not wish to explicitly state all of the items within the bibliography but would still like to show them in our references, we can use the following syntax:

```md
---
nocite: '@*'
...
```

This will force all items to be displayed in the bibliography.


### Include appendix after bibliography

<!--- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41532707/include-rmd-appendix-after-references/42258998#42258998 --->
<!--- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16427637/pandoc-insert-appendix-after-bibliography?noredirect=1&lq=1 --->

By default, the bibliography appears at the very end of the document. However, there can be cases where we want to place additional text after the references, most typically if we wish to include appendices within the document. We can force the position of the references by using `<div id="refs"></div>`, as shown below:

```md
# References

<div id="refs"></div>

# Appendices 

```

We can improve this further by using the **bookdown** package, which offers a [special header](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html#special-headers) for the Appendix as shown with the syntax below:

```md
# References

<div id="refs"></div>

# (APPENDIX) Appendix {-} 

# Appendix A

# Appendix B

```

The numbering style of appendices will be automatically changed in LaTeX/PDF and HTML output (usually in the form A, A.1, A.2, B, B.1, â€¦).





## Cross-referencing within documents {#crossRef}

<!---https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38861041/knitr-rmarkdown-latex-how-to-cross-reference-figures-and-tables--->

Cross-referencing is a useful way of directing your readers through your document, and can be automatically done within R Markdown. While this is explained in [Section 2.6](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/cross-references.html) from the bookdown book [@xie2016bookdown], it is useful to remind readers of how to use these within documents.

To use cross-references, we must:

- **Use a bookdown output format**: cross-referencing is not provided directly within the base **rmarkdown**, but is provided as an extension. We must therefore use an output format (e.g. `html_document2`, `pdf_document2`, `word_document2`) include this in the YAML `output` field.
- **A caption to your figure or table**: figures without a caption will be included directly as images and will therefore not be a numbered figure.
- **A named code chunk**: this provides our identifier for referencing the chunk from within the text.

Having met these conditions, we can make cross-references within the text using the format `\@ref(type:label)`, where `label` is the chunk label and `type` is the environment being referenced (e.g. `tab`, `fig`, `eqn`). An example is provided below:

```yaml
---
output: bookdown::html_document2
---
```
````markdown
See Figure \@ref(fig:cars-plot)

`r ''````{r cars-plot, fig.cap="A plot caption"}
plot(cars)  # a scatterplot
```

See Table \@ref(tab:mtcars)

`r ''````{r mtcars}
knitr::kable(mtcars[1:5, 1:5], caption = "A caption")
```

````
The output of this document is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:crossReferencing). 

```{r crossReferencing, fig.cap = "Example of cross-referencing within an R Markdown document", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/crossReferencing.png", dpi = NA)
```

```{block2, type = "rmdnote"}
We can also cross-reference equations, theorems and section headers, which are explained further in Section [12.3.5](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/bookdown-markdown.html#cross-referencing) of the R Markdown book [@xie2018].
```








## Automatically update document date

<!--- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23449319/yaml-current-date-in-rmarkdown --->

It may be useful for the date of the knitted R Markdown document to automatically update each time we rerun the file. To do this, we can add R code directly to the `date` field in the YAML, and use the `Sys.time()` function to extract the current date. As this function will by default provide the date and time, we must specify the desired date time format as shown below:

```{cat , class.source = 'yaml'}
---
date: "`r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B, %Y')`"
---
```

This will automatically update each time you Knit your document i.e. `r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B, %Y')`. If we wish to customize the format of the dates, we can alter the time format by providing our own text string. Some examples are shown as follows:

- `%B %Y`: `r format(Sys.time(), '%B %Y')`
- `%d/%m/%y`: `r format(Sys.time(), '%d/%m/%y')`
- `%a/%d/%b`: `r format(Sys.time(), '%a %d %b')`

A full table of POSIXct formats is shown in Table \@ref(tab:dateTimeFormats), which allows users to construct their required date format.

```{r dateTimeFormats, echo = FALSE}
formats <-
  read.table(sep = "\t", header = TRUE,  check.names = FALSE, text = 
"Code	Meaning	Code	Meaning
%a	Abbreviated weekday	%A	Full weekday
%b	Abbreviated month	%B	Full month
%c	Locale-specific date and time	%d	Decimal date
%H	Decimal hours (24 hour)	%I	Decimal hours (12 hour)
%j	Decimal day of the year	%m	Decimal month
%M	Decimal minute	%p	Locale-specific AM/PM
%S	Decimal second	%U	Decimal week of the year (starting on Sunday)
%w	Decimal Weekday (0=Sunday)	%W	Decimal week of the year (starting on Monday)
%x	Locale-specific Date	%X	Locale-specific Time
%y	2-digit year	%Y	4-digit year
%z	Offset from GMT	%Z	Time zone (character)")

knitr::kable(formats, caption = "Date Time Formats within R")
```

As a final note, you may even want to include some explanatory text along with the date. We can easily add any text such as "Last Compiled on" before the R code as follows:

```{cat, class.source = 'yaml'}
---
date: "Last compiled on `r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B, %Y')`"
---
```


## Adding multiple authors to document

<!--- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26043807/multiple-authors-and-subtitles-in-rmarkdown-yaml --->

We can add multiple authors to a R Markdown document within the YAML in a number of ways. If we simply want to list them on the same line, we can provide a text string to the document:

```yaml
---
title: "Untitled"
author: "John Doe, John Smith"
---
```

Alternatively, if we wish for each entry to be on its own line we can provide a list of entries to the YAML field. This can be useful if you wish to include further information about each author such as an email address or instituion:

```yaml
---
author: 
- John Doe, Institution One
- John Smith, Institution Two
---
```

We can make use of the markdown syntax `^[]` to add additional information as a footnote to the document. This may be more useful if you have extended information you wish to include for each author, such as providing a contact email, address etc. The exact behaviour will depend on the output format (HTML/PDF/Word):

```yaml
---
author:
- John Doe^[Institution One, email@domain.com]
- John Doe 2^[Institution Two, email2@domain.com]
---
```

Certain R Markdown templates will allow you to specify additional parameters directly within the YAML. For example, the [Radix](https://rstudio.github.io/radix/) output format allows `url`, `affiliation` and `affiliation_url` to be specified. We must first install the Radix package from GitHub:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/radix")
```
We can use the new format by changing the `output` option as specified below:

```yaml
---
title: "Radix for R Markdown"
author:
  - name: "JJ Allaire"
    url: https://github.com/jjallaire
    affiliation: RStudio
    affiliation_url: https://www.rstudio.com
output: radix::radix_article
---
```


## Adding numbered figure captions

<!--- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37116632/r-markdown-html-number-figures --->

We can use the **bookdown** to add figure numbers to the figure captions. An example is provided below:

```yaml
---
output: bookdown::html_document2
---
```

````md
`r ''````{r cars, fig.cap = "An amazing plot"}
plot(cars)
```

`r ''````{r cars2, fig.cap = "Another amazing plot"}
plot(cars)
```
````

Section \@ref(crossRef) demonstrates how we can extend this further by cross-referencing the numbered figures within the text.
